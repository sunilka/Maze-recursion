# Maze-recursion
Printing one possible path in a maze using recursion

 Gray blocks are dead ends (value = 0). 
Following is binary matrix representation of the above maze.

                {1, 0, 0, 0}
                {1, 1, 0, 1}
                {0, 1, 0, 0}
                {1, 1, 1, 1]
Following is the solution matrix (output of program) for the above input matrx.

                {1, 0, 0, 0}
                {1, 1, 0, 0}
                {0, 1, 0, 0}
                {0, 1, 1, 1}
